# NBA-2022-2023-Player-Regular-Season-Stats

This project is based on my favorite sport (basketball) and is used as a deep dive behind the stats that accompany NBA players during the 2022-2023 NBA Regular Season. After every season players will look at certain stats to identify where they need to improve upon for next season and use the stats from each season to aid them in future contract negotiations. From a fan perspective stats can indicate if a player is contributing to helping a team win/develop and aid in comparison debates between certain players. I have used stats from the 2022-2023 regualr season to determine if a player has improved in certain categories such as scoring, assisting, winning games and more.

The objective that I have set for this project is to derive insights that would help evaluate the improvements or deficiencies that have occurred for players during this season. These findings can be used to determine if their players have shown improvement in this season or if they have to make significant changes for next season.

I am tasked with:

- Performing some exploratory data analysis. 
- Deriving insights about the players current statistical output? 
- Identifying key statistics that are sepearting successful players from unsuccessful players?
-  Extraction of sample data sets using SQL. 
-  Analysis of sample data sets with visualizations. 
-  Cleaning the dataset in Excel.
